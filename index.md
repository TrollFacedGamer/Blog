# Benny's Blog

## Welcome to my blog
HHi, my name is Benny I am a senior in high school. 

I am currently studying Full Stack in STEAM where I learn to code in various. I wish to become a game developer and have made some progress in this regard. You may find some of my works in the project section of my [Personal Website](https://trollfacedgamer.github.io/).

## Kelptopia-1
### introduction
Over the summer I had 3 primary activities: going to SAT Prep, working on my personal coding project, and Volunteering. The name of this Blog comes from the coding project which is named Kelptopia-1, despite that it was going to SAT Prep that ate up most of my summer. The only other thing of note was my cousin visiting my family.
SAT Prep
During the summer because of my poor SAT score of 1110, my mom sent me to summer school at A+ Academy. I went to A+ Academy from Monday to Friday, from 12:30 to 3:30. My experience there was all right and not much different from normal school other than the lack of student to student interactions.

At A+ Academy I had two teachers whose rooms I would walk to when entering the building at 12:00 and switching sections at 2:00. A+ Academy, unlike my main DOE school, used sections instead of periods and I had 2: Math for section 1 from 12:30 to 2:00 and Verb from 2:00 to 3:30.

At A+ Academy I found the Verb classes more interesting as I got to talk, while in the Math classes, we just did questions out of the Math Textbook. When my 3 months at A+ Academy were over I found that the most useful thing I got from A+ Academy was probably the TextBook because I was lacking in study material for the SAT.

Though the quality of the Textbooks is rather questionable as they often have mistakes in the questions and answers given, I still use them for my study today because they cover everything from algebra and the basics of ELA, and me not remembering the lessons was the primary thing holding back my SAT score.

Currently, I am going through an SAT Prep offered by STEAM every Tuesday from September to November for the November test. I didn't take the August test and delayed it to November because I don't feel all that confident with my current knowledge and there weren’t any seats for the SAT available nearby for the earlier tests.

### Keptopia
Kelptopia-1 is the coding project mentioned earlier, it is a text-based adventure game based on a concept I came up with while talking with my cousin. The story of Kleptopia is based on a dystopian society set in the future where nearly everything is underwater and running on kelp.

Though the development of the game was primarily meant to serve as practice so my programming skills don't become rusty over the summer, I spent a great part of the development time planning out the text and sequence of the game instead of actually programming.

I used Canva to create the flow chart where I planned the scenes and their sequence. This was by far the most boring part of development as I preferred to be coding rather than writing bits and pieces of text. In addition, Canva didn't come with spelling correction so I had to run everything through Grammarly.

Here is a link to the flow chart [Kelptopia_1_Flowchart](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJwzBXwcw/t1Sl0MRgxUnjc4B3SHvxpQ/edit?utm_content=DAGJwzBXwcw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

I am currently using GitHub to store my code and am planning to use it to turn Kelptopia into a proper website. At one point I started numbering my commits in 0.000.000 format because I wanted the updates to feel more legitimate.

Lastly in Visual Code Studio, I did all the programming in HTML, JS, and CSS, with most of the code being in JS. In Fact, there was so much JS code I had to make another file for it with most of the JS code being for creating buttons because. However, it was the charter creation screen and its associated functions that were the most difficult.

```
const leave = document.createElement("button");
  leave.innerText = "Leave";`
  leave.addEventListener("click", () => {priestScene041();});
  choices.appendChild(leave);
```
```
const CharismaLabel = document.createElement("label")
CharismaLabel.setAttribute("for", "baseCharismaStat")
CharismaLabel.innerText = "Charisma"
choices.appendChild(CharismaLabel)
const baseCharismaStat = document.createElement("input")
baseCharismaStat.type = "number"`
baseCharismaStat.min = 0
baseCharismaStat.max = 5
baseCharismaStat.value = 0
baseCharismaStat.id = "baseCharismaStat"
baseCharismaStat.className = "buildYourCharacter"
choices.appendChild(baseCharismaStat)
```

All in all the project lasted throughout the whole summer with me trying to spend 30 minutes a day on this project, however, that wasn't enough and Keptopia-1 is still nowhere near done. The amount of effort I had put into Kleptopia-1 made me realize how hard game developers had it and grateful for their work.

### Volunteering
Over the summer I had also set out to finish my volunteer hours. However in the first half of the summer, I primarily worked  3 hours in the morning as my SAT Prep got in the way and even that was inconsistent as I had to put aside 2 hours for SAT Prep homework, preventing me from going. 

It was after SAT Prep ended in mid-August that I really had time to do volunteering. After that I got more free time. I will often work from 11 to 5, 10 to 5, or from 9 to 5 to finish my volunteer hours. However, because my mom asked me to do 100 hours because that is how much my sister did I had to work through the whole summer.

My place of volunteering was the Nie Guo MD Clinic and the only Nie Guo MD Clinic. The experience there was all right but rather boring. Volunteering was by far the most disliked activity of my three main summers. Particularly the sorting of the patient files on the shelf was extremely mind-numbing.
