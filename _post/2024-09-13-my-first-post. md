Kelptopia-1
introduction
Over the summer I had 3 primary activities: going to SAT Prep, working on my self made coding and Volunteering. The name of this Blog comes from the coding project which is named Kelptopia-1, however it was going to SAT Prep that ate up most of my summer. The only other thing of note was my cousin visiting my family.
SAT Prep
During the summer because of my poor SAT score of 1110 my mom sent me to summer school at A+ Academy. I went to A+ Academy from Monday to Friday, from 12:30 to 3:30. My experience there was all right and not much different from normal school other than the lack of student to student interactions.

At A+ Academy I had two teachers whose rooms I will walk to when entering the building at 12:00 and switching sections at 2:00. A+ Academy, unlike my main DOE school, used sections instead of periods and I had 2: Math for section 1 from 12:30 to 2:00 and Verb from 2:00 to 3:30.

At A+ Academy I found the Verb classes more interesting as I got to talk, while in the Math classes we just did questions out of the Math Textbook. When my 3 months at A+ Academy was over I found that the most useful thing I got from A+ Academy was probably the TextBook because I was lacking in study material for the SAT.

Though the quality of the Textbooks are rather questionable as they often have mistakes in the questions and answers given, I still use it for my study today because they cover everything from algebra and the basics of ELA. I forgot about which was the primary thing holding back my SAT score.

Currently i am going through a SAT Prep offered by STEAM every Tuesday from September to November for the November test. I didn't take the August test and delayed it to November because I don't feel all that confident at my current knowledge and there werenâ€™t any seats for the SAT available nearby for the earlier tests.

Keptopia
Kelptopia-1 is a text based adventure game based on a concept I came up with while talking with my cousin. The Story of Kleptopia is based around a dystopian society set in the future where nearly everything is under water and running on kelp.


The development of the game was primarily meant to serve as practice so my programming skills do not become rusty over the summer but I did find great enjoyment in making it. Kelptopia-1 was made on Visual Code Studio, saved on github, and planned on Canva. 


I used Canva to create a flow chart where I planned the scenes and their sequence. This was by far the most boring part of development as I preferred to be coding then writing bits and pieces of text. The most frustrating part of the flow chart was that Cnva didn't come with spelling correction so I had to number every line and input them into Grammarly.


Github is where I stored my code and what I plan to use to turn it into a proper website. Everyday I will commit and push my updates into my github repository. I even had the github desktop app which made the committing and pushing processes easier. At one point I started numbering my commits in 0.000.000 format because I wanted the updates to feel more legitimate.


Lastly in Visual code studio is where I did all the programming. I made Kleptopia-1 in HTML, JS, and CSS, with most of the code being in JS.  In Fact, there was so much JS code I had to make another file for it to better organize. Most of the JS code however is primary core creating buttons because I wanted to make as much of the game as possible in JS.


I tried to do 30 minutes every day on this project but that wasn't enough and Keptopia-1 is still nowhere near done. The amount of effort I had put into Kleptopia-1 made me realize how hard game developers had it and grateful for their work.
Volunteering
Over the summer I had also set out to finish my volunteer hours. However in the first half of the summer I primarily worked 3 hours in the morning as my SAT Prep got in the way and even that is inconsistent as i had to put aside 2 hours for SAT Prep homework, preventing me from going. 

It was after SAT Prep ended mid August that I really had time to do volunteering. After that I got more free time. I will often work from 11 to 5, 10 to 5, or from 9 to 5 to finish my volunteer hours. However because my mom asked me to do 100 hours because that is how much my sister did i had to work though the whole summer.

My place of volunteering was the Nie Guo MD Clinic. The experience there was all right but rather boring. Volunteering was by far the most disliked activity of my three main summers actively. Particularly the sorting of the patient files into the shelf was extremely mind numbing.
